# Analysis of Room 18: The Parthenon at the British Museum

We are a university student team associated with *the British Museum* that studied visitor experience in *Room 18: The Parthenon*. This project was the culmination of our data collection.

# Functionality

## Database setup

We converted data tracked from *paper observation sheets* into a **Python database**.
We collected *survey results* into a seperate **excel sheet**.
We compiled all of the *tracking information* into **PDFs**.

## Visualization

We used the databases to graph observations in the most effective format. We ended up making **Heatmaps**, **Bubble Plots**, **Pie Charts**, **Bar Charts**, and **Box-and-Whisker Plots**
